## Task 1: Student Marks Prediction

- Predicted student scores based on hours studied using linear regression.
- Evaluated model performance with R-squared, MSE, T-test, and F-test.

## Task 2: Prediction using Unsupervised ML

- Predicted the optimal number of clusters in the 'IRIS' dataset visually.
- Used K-Means clustering to classify the dataset.

## Task 3: Exploratory Data Analysis - Retail SuperStore

- Explored business insights, weak areas, and problems.
- Created informative dashboards with charts and interpretations.
- Analyzed customer behavior and sales patterns.

## Task 4: Global Terrorism Attacks

- Analyzed global terrorism attacks from 1970-2017, except 1993.
- Investigated over 180,000 attacks, bombings, assassinations, and kidnappings.
- Performed a temporal analysis of terrorist activities.

## Task 5: Exploratory Data Analysis - Sports

- Analyzed IPL data to identify successful teams, players, and factors influencing wins and losses.
- Made recommendations for product endorsements.
- Utilized data visualization techniques, annotations, and animations for storytelling.

## Task 6: Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm

- Created a decision tree classifier for the 'Iris' dataset.
- Visualized the classifier for predicting species.
- Employed various decision tree algorithms to compare performance.
